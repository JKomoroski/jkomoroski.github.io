      <description>Before I provide any guides on my various running projects, I feel the need to describe the lab that I have at my disposal. Today, the lab is very simple consisting of the following hardware components:
 Fiber to the home 100 Mb connection Netgear Nighthawk Home Router () Raspberry Pi 3 Home Server Workstation PC  Beyond the items listed above I have my various home hardware and IOT devices on my network (Cellphones, Laptops, IoT, etc).</description>

      <description>This is my first post on my Hugo powered blog. My goal with this blog at this time is to document various technical guides to projects I&amp;rsquo;m currently involved in. Currently, my projects are fairly limited in scope, focused on a single node Kubernetes cluster run off a home server with various web applications and databases running on it. In the future, I hope to move from some of the more DevOps focused tasks I&amp;rsquo;m working on to more code-centric projects.</description>
