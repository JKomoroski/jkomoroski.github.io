      <description>A while ago I installed a zsh plugin to remind me of my plugins called You Should Use (ysu). The idea behind it is fairly simple, if you have configured an alias for a given command, it will will remind you about that alias if you use the command directly, rather call it via the alias. For example, when I use task warrior to mark a task completed, I may type:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started using Task Warrior, a command line application that helps to track and manage your todo list.
With simple commands like task ls, task add Task Name Here, and task 10 done, you can list, add, and complete tasks in your task list, but the application is built with flexibility in mind. There&amp;rsquo;s an optional backend server which serves an api that the cli and 3rd party applications can utilize, allowing cross platform task syncing across machines and devices.</description>

      <title>My Zsh Setup</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of my terminal and the cli I use everyday. A big reason for that is the customizations I use in it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t just settled on using the terminal as it comes out of the box, which has made it the most effective and productive tool I use everyday. I thought I should share some of those customizations here on my blog, and this first post is focused on Zsh.</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s Talk Kubernetes Ingress</title>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Kubernetes is, I highly suggest to look into it. It&amp;rsquo;s a container orchestration system that runs anywhere. In short, it takes the simple but powerful concept of a containerized application (popularized by docker), and ramps it up to web scale levels. It allows you to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of contaners without the pain of managing the VM and OS layers assocated with a normal deployment.</description>

      <title>Hugo Markdown Setup</title>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got my blog set up I thought I should share the set up I use script I use when writing blog posts (and maybe markdown pages in general).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Hugo is, I suggest you check it out. At its core a static site generator that takes markdown files and compiles them into static html files, but it does so much more. Packaged with the file compiler is a webserver that uses websockets to support a live reload feature.</description>

      <title>My Lab</title>
      <link>https://jkomoroski.github.io/2018/02/20/my-lab/</link>

      <description>Before I provide any guides on my various running projects, I feel the need to describe the lab that I have at my disposal. Today, the lab is very simple consisting of the following hardware components:
 Fiber to the Home 100Mb Connection NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 (R7000) Home Router Raspberry Pi 3 Home Server  Ubuntu 17.10 64bit Linux 4.13.0-32-generic Intel Core i7 CPU 860 @ 2.80GHz 16 Gb Ram 4Tb Storage  Workstation PC  Windows 10 Pro N Intel Core i7 CPU 4790K @ 4.</description>

      <title>Hello World!</title>

      <description>This is my first post on my Hugo powered blog. My goal with this blog at this time is to document various technical guides to projects I&amp;rsquo;m currently involved in. Currently, my projects are fairly limited in scope, focused on a single node Kubernetes cluster run off a home server with various web applications and databases running on it. In the future, I hope to move from some of the more DevOps focused tasks I&amp;rsquo;m working on to more code-centric projects.</description>
