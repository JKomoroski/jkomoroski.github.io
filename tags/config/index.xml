      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of my terminal and the cli I use everyday. A big reason for that is the customizations I use in it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t just settled on using the terminal as it comes out of the box, which has made it the most effective and productive tool I use everyday. I thought I should share some of those customizations here on my blog, and this first post is focused on Zsh.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Kubernetes is, I highly suggest to look into it. It&amp;rsquo;s a container orchestration system that runs anywhere. In short, it takes the simple but powerful concept of a containerized application (popularized by docker), and ramps it up to web scale levels. It allows you to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of contaners without the pain of managing the VM and OS layers assocated with a normal deployment.</description>

      <title>Hugo Markdown Setup</title>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got my blog set up I thought I should share the set up I use script I use when writing blog posts (and maybe markdown pages in general).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Hugo is, I suggest you check it out. At its core a static site generator that takes markdown files and compiles them into static html files, but it does so much more. Packaged with the file compiler is a webserver that uses websockets to support a live reload feature.</description>
