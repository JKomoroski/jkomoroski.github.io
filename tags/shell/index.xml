      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of my terminal and the cli I use everyday. A big reason for that is the customizations I use in it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t just settled on using the terminal as it comes out of the box, which has made it the most effective and productive tool I use everyday. I thought I should share some of those customizations here on my blog, and this first post is focused on Zsh.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got my blog set up I thought I should share the set up I use script I use when writing blog posts (and maybe markdown pages in general).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Hugo is, I suggest you check it out. At its core a static site generator that takes markdown files and compiles them into static html files, but it does so much more. Packaged with the file compiler is a webserver that uses websockets to support a live reload feature.</description>
