      <description>A while ago I installed a zsh plugin to remind me of my plugins called You Should Use (ysu). The idea behind it is fairly simple, if you have configured an alias for a given command, it will will remind you about that alias if you use the command directly, rather call it via the alias. For example, when I use task warrior to mark a task completed, I may type:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started using Task Warrior, a command line application that helps to track and manage your todo list.
With simple commands like task ls, task add Task Name Here, and task 10 done, you can list, add, and complete tasks in your task list, but the application is built with flexibility in mind. There&amp;rsquo;s an optional backend server which serves an api that the cli and 3rd party applications can utilize, allowing cross platform task syncing across machines and devices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of my terminal and the cli I use everyday. A big reason for that is the customizations I use in it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t just settled on using the terminal as it comes out of the box, which has made it the most effective and productive tool I use everyday. I thought I should share some of those customizations here on my blog, and this first post is focused on Zsh.</description>

      <title>Hugo Markdown Setup</title>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got my blog set up I thought I should share the set up I use script I use when writing blog posts (and maybe markdown pages in general).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Hugo is, I suggest you check it out. At its core a static site generator that takes markdown files and compiles them into static html files, but it does so much more. Packaged with the file compiler is a webserver that uses websockets to support a live reload feature.</description>
